# LSD + Music: Gradient-Based fMRI

This documentation accompanies the repository and explains concepts at a high level for recruiters, collaborators, and newcomers.

- **What:** Gradient-based analysis of fMRI connectivity under LSD during music listening.
- **Why:** Validates gradients against traditional metrics (GFC, modularity) and adds spatial & temporal specificity.
- **How:** BrainSpace embeddings; projection of ROIÃ—time into gradient space; Euclidean dynamics.

See the repo root `README.md` for install and usage.
